= Timestamp Batch Task

A batch job task that executes 2 jobs each job prints out the job name and a timestamp to `stdout`. Intended to primarily be used for testing.

== Options

// see syntax (soon to be automatically generated) in spring-cloud-stream starters
The **$$timestamp$$** $$task$$ has the following options:

//tag::configuration-properties[]
$$timestamp.format$$:: $$The timestamp format, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS" by default.$$ *($$String$$, default: `$$yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS$$`)*
//end::configuration-properties[]

== Building with Maven

```
$ ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps
$ cd apps/timestamp-batch-task
$ ./mvnw clean package
```

== Example
```
java -jar timestamp-batch-task-<version>.jar
```

WARNING: Launching a composed task with timestamp-batch app as it is, more than once, may lead task into ERROR status. 
This is due to JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException, as JobInstance won't be unique, if JobParameters remain the same. +
One of the way to handle this is to utilize JobParametersIncrementer as below: +
jobBuilderFactory.get("job1").incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer()) +
jobBuilderFactory.get("job2").incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer()) +
In this case RunIdIncrementer will allow the app to be launched multiple times, each having its own JobInstance
